  abstract = {Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) was formed ~7500 years ago by hybridization
	between B. rapa and B. oleracea, followed by chromosome doubling,
	a process known as allopolyploidy. Together with more ancient polyploidizations,
	this conferred an aggregate 72× genome multiplication since the origin
	of angiosperms and high gene content. We examined the B. napus genome
	and the consequences of its recent duplication. The constituent An
	and Cn subgenomes are engaged in subtle structural, functional, and
	epigenetic cross-talk, with abundant homeologous exchanges. Incipient
	gene loss and expression divergence have begun. Selection in B. napus
	oilseed types has accelerated the loss of glucosinolate genes, while
	preserving expansion of oil biosynthesis genes. These processes provide
	insights into allopolyploid evolution and its relationship with crop
	domestication and improvement.},

  abstract = {For seagrasses, seasonal and daily variations in light and temperature
	represent the mains factors driving their distribution along the
	bathymetric cline. Changes in these environmental factors, due to
	climatic and anthropogenic effects, can compromise their survival.
	In a framework of conservation and restoration, it becomes crucial
	to improve our knowledge about the physiological plasticity of seagrass
	species along environmental gradients. Here, we aimed to identify
	differences in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, involved in
	the acclimation along the depth gradient in the seagrass Posidonia
	oceanica, and to improve the available molecular resources in this
	species, which is an important requisite for the application of eco-genomic
	approaches. To do that, from plant growing in shallow (-5 m) and
	deep (-25 m) portions of a single meadow, (i) we generated two reciprocal
	Expressed Sequences Tags (EST) libraries using a Suppressive Subtractive
	Hybridization (SSH) approach, to obtain depth/specific transcriptional
	profiles, and (ii) we identified proteins differentially expressed,
	using the highly innovative USIS mass spectrometry methodology, coupled
	with 1D-SDS electrophoresis and labeling free approach. Mass spectra
	were searched in the open source Global Proteome Machine (GPM) engine
	against plant databases and with the X!Tandem algorithm against a
	local database. Transcriptional analysis showed both quantitative
	and qualitative differences between depths. EST libraries had only
	the 3\% of transcripts in common. A total of 315 peptides belonging
	to 64 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. ATP synthase
	subunits were among the most abundant proteins in both conditions.
	Both approaches identified genes and proteins in pathways related
	to energy metabolism, transport and genetic information processing,
	that appear to be the most involved in depth acclimation in P. oceanica.
	Their putative rules in acclimation to depth were discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite being a major international crop, our understanding of the
	wheat genome is relatively poor due to its large size and complexity.
	To gain a greater understanding of wheat genome diversity, we have
	identified single nucleotide polymorphisms between 16 Australian
	bread wheat varieties. Whole-genome shotgun Illumina paired read
	sequence data were mapped to the draft assemblies of chromosomes
	7A, 7B and 7D to identify more than 4 million intervarietal SNPs.
	SNP density varied between the three genomes, with much greater density
	observed on the A and B genomes than the D genome. This variation
	may be a result of substantial gene flow from the tetraploid Triticum
	turgidum, which possesses A and B genomes, during early co-cultivation
	of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In addition, we examined SNP density
	variation along the chromosome syntenic builds and identified genes
	in low-density regions which may have been selected during domestication
	and breeding. This study highlights the impact of evolution and breeding
	on the bread wheat genome and provides a substantial resource for
	trait association and crop improvement. All SNP data are publically
	available on a generic genome browser GBrowse at www.wheatgenome.info.},

  journal = {New Phytol},
  year = {2014},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {How do chromosomal regions with differing degrees of homology and
	homeology interact at meiosis? We provide a novel analytical method
	based on simple genetics principles which can help to answer this
	important question. This method interrogates high-throughput molecular
	marker data in order to infer chromosome behavior at meiosis in interspecific
	hybrids. We validated this method using high-resolution molecular
	marker karyotyping in two experimental Brassica populations derived
	from interspecific crosses among B. juncea, B. napus and B. carinata,
	using a single nucleotide polymorphism chip. This method of analysis
	successfully identified meiotic interactions between chromosomes
	sharing different degrees of similarity: full-length homologs; full-length
	homeologs; large sections of primary homeologs; and small sections
	of secondary homeologs. This analytical method can be applied to
	any allopolyploid species or fertile interspecific hybrid in order
	to detect meiotic associations. This genetic information can then
	be used to identify which genomic regions share functional homeology
	(i.e., retain enough similarity to allow pairing and segregation
	at meiosis). When applied to interspecific hybrids for which reference
	genome sequences are available, the question of how differing degrees
	of homology and homeology affect meiotic interactions may finally
	be resolved.},
