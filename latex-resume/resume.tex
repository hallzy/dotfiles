{January 2015--\\August 2015}
{Ericsson {\normalfont Software Developer Co-op}}
{Burnaby, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Tested and developed quality of service and policy based routing software
  solutions on a variety of Ericsson's routing platforms using a combination of manual
  router configurations and scripts for testing.
\item Presented demos showing the functionality and progress of policy based
  routing during the testing and development phases.

\section{Technical Projects}

\begin{entrylist}

\entry
{April 2014}
{Electromagnetically Tethered Robot}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructed a robot using one sold piece of aluminum resulting in usable parts
that we used for the remote and
robot.
\item Designed, built, and programmed an autonomous robot that follows an
electromagnetic signal produced by a
solenoid on a remote that our group also built, resulting in a high grade. The
remote sends binary data through
the magnetic field that tell the robot to spin 180 degrees, move back, move
forward, and parallel park.
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{January 2014}
{Alarm Clock}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Programmed a simulation of an 8052 chip using an Altera DE2 Logic Board with
Assembly to work as a 12-hour,
am/pm clock, which resulted in an alarm clock that had the option to set the
current time, set an alarm time, and
have the alarm sound a buzzer at 2kHz once the alarm time is reached.
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{August 2012}
{Laptop Repair}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Disassembled a nonfunctional laptop, testing various components, and learnt what
different parts of the
motherboard accomplish, allowing for increased knowledge of how a computer
works, and what different parts of
a motherboard are.
\item Repaired a laptop by reflowing the solder on the motherboard, allowing the
solder to melt just enough to fill in
any potential electrical breaks in the circuit that may have appeared over time,
resulting in a working laptop.
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Other Work Experience}

\begin{entrylist}

\entry
{July 2014--\\August 2014}
{ByteCom Computer Services {\normalfont Computer Repair Technician}}
{Surrey, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed broken, slow, and non-responsive computers in a computer repair shop by
replicating the customer’s
problem, identifying the cause of the problem, and fixing the problem with the
tools we had, resulting in satisfied
customers.
\item Techniques used to fix the computers include antivirus programs, file and
registry manipulations, and taking the
computers apart to diagnose hardware problems, resulting in faster, and better
working computers.
\end{itemize}
}

\entry
{July 2013--\\August 2013}
{Self Employed {\normalfont Landscaping/ Labour}}
{Surrey, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Broke stucco off the rear exterior wall of a house, fixed rotten parts of a
leaking wall, and reapplied tar paper, as
well as paved a pathway, resulting in a fixed wall, which could now be covered
again with another material.
\item Learned to use new power tools quickly in order to complete the job, including
angle grinders and table saws,
resulting in faster labour, and more experience with various tools.
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{June 2013}
{Self Employed {\normalfont High School Science Tutor}}
{Langley, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Tutored a student in grade 10 science for their final exam by providing clear
instructions and examples that they
were able to understand, and apply in the exam, allowing the student to pass
their test.
\item Provided small tests with several questions on each to test understanding of
the material, resulting in better
preparation for the real final exam.
\end{itemize}

\entry
{April 2014--\\Sept. 2014}
{Delview Secondary {\normalfont Online Classroom Development}}
{North Delta, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Helped a high school science teacher develop an online classroom
environment. Duties include writing Google
Scripts to grade assignments, and take attendance, resulting in less marking
time for the teacher so that he can
dedicate more time to teaching his students, and instant feedback, as the
assignments email the student their
results.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with a group of coaches to coach a range of age groups over the three
season period.
\item Duties include teaching how to play baseball by teaching proper throwing,
catching, fielding, and hitting
mechanics, resulting in increased performance by every player.
\item Learned to explain our expectations of our players clearly, and learned to
explain new concepts to the players
by giving easy to understand examples, resulting in constant improvement.
