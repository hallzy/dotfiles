### Making a Contribution

If there is something that is not clear in any of the documentation, or you have
suggestions for a better way of doing something, or possible configurations that
I have missed that would be useful, let me know.

You can create an issue in the github issue tracker, or make the changes
yourself in a forked repository and issue a pull request.
