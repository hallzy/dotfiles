DISCLAIMER
==========

I want to be very explicit in saying that while I have Donald Trump quotes here,
I do not in any way support him or condone anything he has said or done.

Trump is a pathological liar, a racist, a misogynist, a bigot, and a fascist. He
is the scum of the earth, a terrible human being, and lacks any and all empathy.
He shows nothing but disrespect to soldiers, particularly captured or fallen
soldiers. He blatantly rejects science and any truths or facts that do not align
with his own personal gains and interests.

The English language does not have words to describe my hatred for this piece of
garbage and frankly, I am embarrassed to be part of the same species as him.

I keep these quotes as a reminder to me and everyone else what happens when you
elect an openly racist misogynistic bigot into office. This is history repeating
itself, but hopefully we get out of it better than we did last time. I don't
ever want to see this again in my lifetime.
