DISCLAIMER
==========

I want to be very explicit in saying that while I have Donald Trump quotes here,
I do not in any way support him or condone anything he has said or done. He is
the scum of the earth, a terrible human being, and lacks empathy for anyone that
isn't him. The English language does not have words to describe my hatred for
this man. Frankly, I am embarrassed to be part of the same species as him.

I keep these quotes because I don't want to forget the insanely stupid things he
has said. Donald Trump is a reminder to everyone why voting is so important, and
I want to be reminded of that, and I hope others do as well so that this doesn't
happen again.
