Even if you believe a creator god invented the laws of physics, would you so insult him as to suggest that he might capriciously and arbitrarily violate them in order to walk on water, or turn water into wine as a cheap party trick at a wedding?

We cannot, of course, disprove God, just as we can't disprove Thor, fairies, leprechauns, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

I don't think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.

I don't understand why the US government places such value on finding soldiers missing in action. They performed poorly and got caught and deserved what they got.

I tested very positively [for Covid-19]. In another sense, I tested positively toward negative, right? So no. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative. But that's a way of saying it. Positively toward the negative.

[In the revolutionary war] our army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets' red glare, it had nothing but victory.

I mean, 40 Wall Street, [The Trump Building], actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually before the World Trade Center the tallest, and then when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second-tallest, and now it's the tallest.

This is an incredible plane - it's stealth, you can't see it. So when I talk to even people from the other side, they're trying to order our plane. They like the fact that you can't see it. I said, ‘how would it do in battle with your plane?' They say, 'well we have one problem - we can't see your plane.' That's a big problem.

I don't want you to hang my portraits in your offices. Because a president is
not an icon, an idol, or a portrait. Hang pictures of your children instead. And
