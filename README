This is the a repo of the dot files that I use.

Currently, it is only a .vimrc file, which is a slightly modified version of the .vimrc file from https://github.com/mscoutermarsh

Currently the only change is the colour scheme, which is badwolf. This can be found in the colours directory of this repo.

To use this .vimrc file, move the file into ~/.vimrc

To use the colour scheme, move badwolf.vim to ~/.vim/colors/
